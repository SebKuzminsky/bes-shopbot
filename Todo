Mechanical:

    align all axes to be perpendicular

    tweak limit positions - try to make it so it has time to stop when jogging in world mode

    square the spindle

    check spindle power supply

    build a table per the Shopbot instruction

    redo spindle control?  later


fix dust removal system if needed


linuxcnc config:

    Tune steppers & encoders

        X:

            Steppers are labeled ASM98AA-T7.2
            Stepper amps are labeled ASD30A-A

            looks like about 11,666 steps/rev on the steppers

            1 encoder line per step, so 4 encoder edges per step

            2.5 teeth/cm on the rack

            30 teeth on the pinion gear


    tune acceleration

    estop:

	want to see diff between commanded steps and actual encoder feedback (mod backlash)

	discrepancy between the two Y joints should cause estop

    don't load unused realtime comps

    get rid of broken halui MDI commands

    clean up pyvcp panel

    no joint-mode jogging of joint 3 (x2)

    can't disable limit override when not on a limit...

    the X prox switch is very noisy, needs debounce.  Or can it be
    cleaned up mechanically somehow?  Y2 prox looks fine.  How are the
    other proxes?

    machine needs rehome after e-stop, how to get around that?

    fix spindle


linuxcnc bugs and feature requests:

    in joint mode it honors the soft limits, but in world mode it doesn't

    no incremental jogging in coordinated mode on gantry machines :-(

    nontrivkins machines need [TRAJ]DEFAULT_ACCELERATION, which is lame
