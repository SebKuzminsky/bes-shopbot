Mechanical:

    build a table per the Shopbot instruction

    tweak limit positions

        make the X axis perpendicular to Y

        try to make it so it has time to stop when jogging in world mode

    ------

    redo spindle control?  later

    z prox bracket interferes with the spindle fan

    tidy electrical box


fix dust removal system if needed


linuxcnc config:

    stepper feedback encoders go to stepper amps, amps provide
    fake(?) encoder ticks to linuxcnc, and an error signal if there are
    lost steps(?).  See if we can drive both the amp encoder inputs and
    the linuxcnc encoder inputs from the stepper encoders

    verify stepper amp timings

    tune vel & acceleration

    estop:

	want to see diff between commanded steps and actual encoder feedback (mod backlash)

	discrepancy between the two Y joints should cause estop

    don't load unused realtime comps

    get rid of broken halui MDI commands

    dust collector (dust fan vfd is "hitachi sj200")

    clean up pyvcp panel

    no joint-mode jogging of joint 3 (y2)

    the X prox switch is very noisy, needs debounce (or was this fixed by
    reseating the cable?).  Or can it be cleaned up mechanically somehow?
    Y2 prox looks fine.  How are the other proxes?

    machine needs rehome after e-stop, how to get around that?

    spindle:

        spindle needs key in engaged position in spindle interlock (on control box)

        spindle warm-up first time: 30 minute ramp up to 18k
        
        spindle warm-up after that: 10 minute ramp up to 18k

        f9 turns vfd power on but doesnt resume spindle motion at the last commanded speed

        ~4k rpm is min speed

        switch interface to spindle vfd from arduino to modbus or mesa


linuxcnc bugs and feature requests:

    in joint mode it honors the soft limits, but in world mode it doesn't

    no incremental jogging in coordinated mode on gantry machines :-(

    nontrivkins machines need [TRAJ]DEFAULT_ACCELERATION, which is lame
