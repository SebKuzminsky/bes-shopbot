Mechanical:

    level the machine

    align and true the machine

    build a table per the Shopbot instruction


Equipment & tooling:

    get a permanent console for it: monitor, usb keyboard & mouse,
    usb wifi, powered usb hub


fix dust removal system


machine should have some hard stops (better than driving the gantry off
the table)


linuxcnc config:

    Tune steppers & encoders

    fix servo thread function order

    discrepancy between the two X joints should cause estop

    jogging in joint mode (Y & Z only!) works fine, but in coordinated
    mode it overshoots

    get rid of broken halui MDI commands

    no incremental jogging in coordinated mode

    no joint-mode jogging of joint 3 (x2)

    encoder scaling uses a separate scale component

    can't disable limit override when not on a limit...

    do the encoders have index?  if so home to that
