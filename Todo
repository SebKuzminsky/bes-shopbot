Mechanical:

    X axis is good, Y axis is good, Z is loose and off in the X and Y angles

    tweak limit positions - try to make it so it has time to stop when jogging in world mode

    check spindle power supply

    build a table per the Shopbot instruction

    redo spindle control?  later

    z prox bracket interferes with the spindle fan

    tidy electrical box


fix dust removal system if needed


linuxcnc config:

    stepper feedback encoders go to stepper amps, amps provide
    fake(?) encoder ticks to linuxcnc, and an error signal if there are
    lost steps(?).  See if we can drive both the amp encoder inputs and
    the linuxcnc encoder inputs from the stepper encoders

    verify stepper amp timings

    tune vel & acceleration

    estop:

	want to see diff between commanded steps and actual encoder feedback (mod backlash)

	discrepancy between the two Y joints should cause estop

    don't load unused realtime comps

    get rid of broken halui MDI commands

    clean up pyvcp panel

    no joint-mode jogging of joint 3 (x2)

    can't disable limit override when not on a limit...

    the Y prox switch is very noisy, needs debounce.  Or can it be
    cleaned up mechanically somehow?  X2 prox looks fine.  How are the
    other proxes?

    machine needs rehome after e-stop, how to get around that?

    fix spindle


linuxcnc bugs and feature requests:

    in joint mode it honors the soft limits, but in world mode it doesn't

    no incremental jogging in coordinated mode on gantry machines :-(

    nontrivkins machines need [TRAJ]DEFAULT_ACCELERATION, which is lame
